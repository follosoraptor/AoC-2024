# Advent of Code 2024
Hello! I am by no means a god at coding and only have a few C/C++ projects under my belt from my university courses, but I would like to further my familiarity with specifically the Python language. I am not sure if I will complete every day of the challenge, but I sure would like to make a decent attempt at it. In this repository, I will store all my solutions as I complete each day.

Good luck have fun to me, I suppose!
